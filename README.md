This {is|will be} a speedcubing timer website, complete with statistics and mobile integration.

This website is more of a project to help us learn more about web development -- both front-end and back-end -- than to provide a reliable service for cubers.

WIP.

Upon cloning this repo, you will have to create `db.sqlite3` and run `./manage.py migrate` to correctly set up the database.
