This {is|will be} a speedcubing timer website, complete with statistics and mobile integration.

This website is more of a project to help us learn more about web development -- both front-end and back-end -- than to provide a reliable service for cubers.

WIP.

Upon cloning this repo, you will have to create `db.sqlite3` and run `./manage.py migrate` to correctly set up the database.

## Setup

This will take you through the process of creating a python3 virtualenv for this project.

1. Install `virtualenv` and `pip` (not described here).
2. un `virtualenv -p python3 env` in the root directory of this project.
3. `source ./env/bin/activate`
4. Then, install Django with `pip install django`.

You should be good then.
